- Iâ€™m Jenderson Abarca, I'm 15 years old and a candidate to frontend web developer, I am interested in all branches of web development, especially frontend web development, I currently dominate about html, css, javascript and some frameworks/libraries ( JQuery, Bootstrap, SwiperJS, React, VueJs etc. ). Currently I study more in depth what I already know and some other branches of frontend web development, backend web develpment ( like Python and PHP ) and Graphic Design.
